In the discussion of comparative wordlists, we created an object called `translate` which you could look up using words in both German and Spanish in order to get corresponding words in English. What problem might arise with this approach? Can you suggest a way to avoid this problem?

Given that some words are homonyms, depending on the context, the translation could be wrong.
Maybe giving a full sentence while highlighting the word we want to translate might help with this issue.
