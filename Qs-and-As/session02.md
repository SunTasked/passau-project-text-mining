-----------------------

**Question 9 :**

Can the grammar in grammar1 be used to describe sentences that are more than 20 words in length?

grammar1 = nltk.CFG.fromstring("""
  S -> NP VP
  VP -> V NP | V NP PP
  PP -> P NP
  V -> "saw" | "ate" | "walked"
  NP -> "John" | "Mary" | "Bob" | Det N | Det N PP
  Det -> "a" | "an" | "the" | "my"
  N -> "man" | "dog" | "cat" | "telescope" | "park"
  P -> "in" | "on" | "by" | "with"
  """)

**Answer:** 

Yes. Consider the following expansion using grammar1:

S
NP VP
Det N PP VP
Det N P NP VP
Det N P Det N PP VP
And so on...

Basically you go from `NP -> Det N PP` to `PP -> P NP` and back.

**Question 10 :** 

Consider the sequence of words: `Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo'. This is a grammatically correct sentence, as explained at {http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_buffalo_Buffalo_buffalo}. Consider the tree diagram presented on this Wikipedia page, and write down a suitable grammar. Normalize case to lowercase, to simulate the problem that a listener has when hearing this sentence. Can you find other parses for this sentence? How does the number of parse trees grow as the sentence gets longer? (More examples of these sentences can be found at \utrl{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homophonous_phrases}).

**Answer:**

S -> NP VP
NP -> NP RC | PN N
RC -> NP V
VP -> V NP
PN -> buffalo
N -> buffalo
V -> buffalo

For this particular case, we can find another parse:

                (S
                    (NP
                        (PN buffalo)
                        (N buffalo)
                    )
                    (VP
                        (V buffalo)
                        (NP
                            (NP
                                (PN buffalo)
                                (N buffalo)
                            )
                            (RC
                                (NP
                                    (PN buffalo)
                                    (N buffalo)
                                )
                                (V buffalo)
                            )
                        )
                    )
                )

**Question 12 :** 

Encode the tree represented using labeled bracketing and use nltk.Tree() to check that it is well-formed. Now use draw() to display the tree.

**Question 14 :**
Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample nltk.corpus.treebank and extract the productions with the help of Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once. Productions with the same left hand side, and similar right hand sides can be collapsed, resulting in an equivalent but more compact set of rules.

**Answer:** 
            #Process each tree of the Treebank corpus sample nltk.corpus.treebank and extract the productions with the help of Tree.productions(). Discard the productions that occur only once.
